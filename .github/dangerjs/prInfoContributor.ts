3. Once the Github PR is approved, we synchronize it into our internal git repository
4. In the internal git repository we do the final review, collect approvals from core owners and make sure all the automated tests are passing
    - At this point we may do some adjustments to the proposed change, or extend it by adding tests or documentation.
5. If the change is approved and passes the tests it is merged into the \`master\` branch
6. On next sync from the internal git repository merged change will appear in this public Github repository
